        <p class="producttext"> Jagged Little Thrill is the third studio album by American R&B group Jagged Edge. It was released by So So Def and Columbia on June 26, 2001, in the United States. The album's name is a spin on Alanis Morissette's album Jagged Little Pill (1995). The album debuted at number 3 on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 215,000 copies in the US, outranking their previous album, J.E. Heartbreak (1999) which had peaked at number eighth on the chart; the album is the group's highest peaking album to date (tied with Hard). However, it was not as successful as the group's previous album, though still successful; achieving Platinum status by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Jagged Little Thrill has sold 1.5 million copies in the US.</p>
